A bit is the basic unit of information in computer science. The Binary system
are a base 2 numbering system where by each place value (or bit) can hold
either 1 or 0. In this system once you have counted to 1, rather than counting again
up to 2, you simply start the at the next place value to the left. As an example
if we are counting to three we first count 1 which would then be led by another 1, so
the number three would be 11 in binary.

A byte is equivalent to eight place values (bits) in binary. This would be written as:
00000000 <----- which is one byte of information.
A byte is sometimes also referred to as an octet.

In C programming differing data types require the allocation of a specific amount
of memory in bytes.
-A char: 1 byte
-A bool: 1 byte, however, only one bit is actually 'filled', the rest of the bits are in
a bool are simply fluffer for practicality sake.
-An short int: 2 bytes
-A long int: 4 bytes this is the more likely type of int data datype you'll see among
modern systems.
-A float: 4 bytes
-A double: 8 bytes
-A string: Is an array of chars with a binary zero (\0) as its final char, the number
of bytes in a string depends on the number of chars in its array.

data type uses a single byte of memory. A
